# SMLTest

This is a gameplay prototype for Noxel
Wanted features ;
- Small / Medium / Large system : Smalls are the most agile, capable of dealing strikes with a chirurgical precision, but lack autonomy and brute force; 
Mediums are capable of fight but aren't the most powerful, they can host Smalls to increase their autonomy, they can really attack when key elements have been destroyed by Smalls;
Large are the most powerful, can spawn smalls and host mediums, are controlled by multiple players, but they have weaknesses. They are destroyed module by module, and are not to be face to face with another Large.
- Multiplayer, ofc
- Respawning and switching classes
- Objectives
